        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>The information in the head element is useful for the browser and SEO</li>
        <li>Child elements are nested inside of a parent element (e.g. body)</li>
        <li>An element refers to the entire element from the opening tag to the closing tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag always has a "/" to represent a closure.</li>
        <li>Within the "img" element, the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
        <li>The "section" elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
        <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or a block of text</li>
        <li>The "ul,ol, and li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items</li>
        <li>The "br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
        <li>The "a" element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages </li>
        <li>The "href" attribute points to the URL for the link</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>Using external CSS style sheets is usually the preferred method as it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
      <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
      <li>The special wild card symbol, "*", is used when applying a rule to all elements visible on the page</li>
      <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
